This project is an AI model-agnostic security framework and ruleset (internally nicknamed "Project CodeGuard" when developed at Cisco) that embeds secure-by-default practices into AI coding workflows (generation and review). It ships core security rules, translators for popular coding agents, and validators to test rule compliance.


## Why Project CodeGuard?

AI coding agents are transforming software engineering, but this speed can introduce security vulnerabilities. Is your AI coding agent implementation introducing security vulnerabilities?

- ‚ùå Skipping input validation
- ‚ùå Hardcoding secrets and credentials
- ‚ùå Using weak cryptographic algorithms
- ‚ùå Relying on unsafe functions
- ‚ùå Missing authentication/authorization checks
- ‚ùå Missing any other security best practice

Project CodeGuard solves this by embedding security best practices directly into AI coding agent workflows. 

**During and After Code Generation.**

Project CodeGuard is designed to integrate seamlessly across the entire AI coding lifecycle. 
- **Before code generation**, rules can be used for the design of a product and for spec-driven development. You can use the rules in the ‚Äúplanning phase‚Äù of an AI coding agent to steer models toward secure patterns from the start.
- **During code generation**, rules can help AI agents to prevent security issues as code is being written.
- **After code generation**, AI agents like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Codex, Windsurf, and Claude Code can use the rules for code review. 


## Security Coverage

Our rules cover essential security domains:

- **üîê Cryptography**: Safe algorithms (including post-quantum cryptography), secure key management, certificate validation
- **üõ°Ô∏è Input Validation**: SQL injection prevention, XSS protection, command injection defense
- **üîë Authentication**: MFA best practices, OAuth/OIDC, secure session management
- **‚ö° Authorization**: RBAC/ABAC, access control, IDOR prevention
- **üì¶ Supply Chain**: Dependency security, SBOM generation, vulnerability management
- **‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Security**: IaC hardening, container security, Kubernetes best practices
- **üì± Platform Security**: Mobile apps, web services, API security
- **üîç Data Protection**: Privacy, encryption at rest/transit, secure storage

## Quick Start

Get started in minutes:

1. **Download the rules** from our [releases page](https://github.com/project-codeguard/rules/releases)
2. **Copy to your project** - Place AI agent and IDE specific rules in your repository
3. **Start coding** - AI assistants will automatically follow security best practices

- Additional details in the [Get Started ‚Üí](https://project-codeguard.org/getting-started/)


## How It Works

1. **Security rules** are written in unified markdown format (`sources/` directory)
2. **Conversion tools** translate rules to IDE-specific formats (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Claude Code)
3. **Release automation** packages rules into downloadable ZIP files
4. **AI assistants** reference these rules when generating or reviewing code
5. **Secure code** is produced automatically without developer intervention

## üìÑ Licensing

This project uses dual licensing:

- **Security Rules & Documentation**: Licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) - includes all rule files, documentation, and project content
- **Source Code & Tools**: The `src/` directory is licensed under [Apache License 2.0](src/LICENSE.md) - includes conversion tools, validators, and other software components

This licensing approach ensures the security rules remain freely accessible and reusable while providing appropriate terms for software components.
