Is your AI coding agent implementation introducing security vulnerabilities?</p> <ul> <li>Skipping input validation</li> <li>Hardcoding secrets and credentials</li> <li>Using weak cryptographic algorithms</li> <li>Relying on unsafe functions</li> <li>Missing authentication/authorization checks</li> <li>Missing any other security best practice</li> </ul> <p>Project CodeGuard solves this by embedding security best practices directly into AI coding agent workflows. </p> <p>Before, During, and After Code Generation.</p> <p>Project CodeGuard can be used before, during and after code generation. They can be used at the AI agent planning phase or for initial specification-driven engineering tasks. Project CodeGuard rules can also be used to prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced during code generation. They can also be used by automated code-review AI agents. </p> <p>For example, a rule focused on input validation could work at multiple stages: it might suggest secure input handling patterns during code generation, flag potentially unsafe user or AI agent input processing in real-time and then validate that proper sanitization and validation logic is present in the final code. Another rule targeting secret management could prevent hardcoded credentials from being generated, alert developers when sensitive data patterns are detected, and verify that secrets are properly externalized using secure configuration management. </p> <p>This multi-stage methodology ensures that security considerations are woven throughout the development process rather than being an afterthought, creating multiple layers of protection while maintaining the speed and productivity that make AI coding tools so valuable. </p>"},{"location":"#security-coverage","title":"Security Coverage","text":"<p>Our rules cover essential security domains:</p> <ul> <li>Cryptography: Safe algorithms (including post-quantum cryptography), secure key management, certificate validation</li> <li>Input Validation: SQL injection prevention, XSS protection, command injection defense</li> <li>Authentication: MFA best practices, OAuth/OIDC, secure session management</li> <li>Authorization: RBAC/ABAC, access control, IDOR prevention</li> <li>Supply Chain: Dependency security, SBOM generation, vulnerability management</li> <li>Cloud Security: IaC hardening, container security, Kubernetes best practices</li> <li>Platform Security: Mobile apps, web services, API security</li> <li>Data Protection: Privacy, encryption at rest/transit, secure storage</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#quick-start","title":"Quick Start","text":"<p>Get started in minutes:</p> <ol> <li>Download the rules from our releases page</li> <li>Copy to your project - Place IDE-specific rules in your repository</li> <li>Start coding - AI assistants will automatically follow security best practices</li> </ol> <p>Get Started \u2192 View on GitHub </p>"},{"location":"#how-it-works","title":"How It Works","text":"<ol> <li>Security rules are written in a unified markdown format</li> <li>Conversion tools translate rules to IDE-specific formats</li> <li>AI assistants reference these rules when generating or reviewing code</li> <li>Secure code is produced automatically without developer intervention</li> </ol>"},{"location":"#community","title":"Community","text":"<ul> <li>\ud83d\udccb Issues: Report bugs or request features</li> <li>\ud83d\udcac Discussions: Join the conversation</li> <li>\ud83e\udd1d Contributing: Learn how to contribute</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#note","title":"Note","text":"<p>This is a strategic move by Cisco to raise the security posture of the entire ecosystem\u2014not just Cisco itself.

The primary purpose of CodeGuard is to help you avoid introducing new security vulnerabilities as you write code, by providing agentic rules and guidance directly in your IDE. If you perform a code review using these rules, Project CodeGuard will most likely identify many of the same vulnerabilities that security scanning tools would find. However, CodeGuard is not a comprehensive substitute for security scanners\u2014automated security tools are designed to thoroughly analyze your entire codebase and catch a broader range of issues. For best results, use CodeGuard rules in combination with your existing security scanners to maximize your code\u2019s security.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#still-have-questions","title":"Still have questions?","text":"<p>Can't find your answer? </p> <ul> <li>Open an issue with your question</li> <li>Start a discussion to chat with the community</li> </ul>"},{"location":"getting-started/","title":"Getting Started","text":"<p>Get up and running with Project CodeGuard in just a few steps.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#project-codeguard-introduction-video","title":"Project CodeGuard Introduction Video","text":"<p>This video introduces Project CodeGuard and includes several demos on how to use it during code generation and code review with Claude Code, Codex, and other coding agents.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<p>Before you begin, familiarize yourself with how rules work in your IDE:</p> CursorWindsurfGitHub Copilot <p>Cursor uses <code>.cursor/rules</code> for rule configuration.</p> <p> Cursor Rules Documentation</p> <p>Windsurf uses <code>.windsurf/rules</code> for rule configuration.</p> <p> Windsurf Rules Documentation</p> <p>GitHub Copilot uses <code>.github/instructions</code> for rule configuration.</p> <p> GitHub Copilot Instructions</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#installation","title":"Installation","text":""},{"location":"getting-started/#option-1-download-pre-built-rules-recommended","title":"Option 1: Download Pre-built Rules (Recommended)","text":"<ol> <li>Download: Visit the Releases page and download the IDE-specific ZIP file:<ul> <li><code>ide-rules-all.zip</code> - All IDE formats (recommended for teams using multiple tools)</li> <li><code>ide-rules-cursor.zip</code> - Cursor only</li> <li><code>ide-rules-windsurf.zip</code> - Windsurf only</li> <li><code>ide-rules-copilot.zip</code> - GitHub Copilot only</li> </ul> </li> <li>Extract: Unzip the downloaded file</li> <li>Install: Copy the relevant IDE-specific rules to your project root:<ul> <li>For Cursor: Copy <code>.cursor/</code> directory to your project</li> <li>For Windsurf: Copy <code>.windsurf/</code> directory to your project</li> <li>For GitHub Copilot: Copy <code>.github/</code> directory to your project</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Repository Level Installation</p> <p>Installing at the repository level ensures all team members benefit from the security rules automatically when they clone the repository.</p> <p>Hidden Files on macOS/Linux</p> <p>On macOS/Linux, you may need to show hidden files:</p> <ul> <li>macOS Finder: Press Cmd+Shift+. to toggle visibility</li> <li>Linux: Use <code>ls -la</code> in terminal or enable \"Show Hidden Files\" in your file manager</li> </ul>"},{"location":"getting-started/#claude-code-plugin","title":"Claude Code Plugin","text":"<p>Claude Code uses a plugin system instead of manual file installation:</p> <pre><code># Add the Project CodeGuard marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add project-codeguard/rules\n\n# Install the security plugin\n/plugin install codeguard-security@project-codeguard\n</code></pre> <p>The plugin will be automatically loaded and apply security rules to your code.
