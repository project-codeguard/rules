## Network Segmentation Guidelines

Essential practices for implementing secure network architecture to limit attack surface and prevent lateral movement.

### Purpose of Network Segmentation

Network segmentation is the core of multi-layer defense in depth for modern services. Proper segmentation slows down attackers by preventing:
- SQL injections from providing direct database access
- Compromised workstations from accessing sensitive systems
- Lateral movement between organizational servers
- Access to command and control servers from compromised internal systems

### Three-Layer Security Architecture

Implement a mandatory three-tier architecture with distinct security zones:

#### Frontend Layer
Contains internet-facing components:
- Load balancers
- Application layer firewalls (WAF)
- Web servers
- Web caches

Frontend systems should only communicate with middleware layer, never directly with backend.

#### Middleware Layer  
Houses business logic and processing:
- Web applications implementing system logic
- Authorization services
- Analytics services
- Message queues
- Stream processing platforms

Middleware mediates all communication between frontend and backend layers.

#### Backend Layer
Stores sensitive data and critical systems:
- SQL databases
- LDAP directories and domain controllers
- Cryptographic key storage
- File servers

Backend systems should only accept connections from middleware layer.

### Segmentation Implementation

#### Communication Flow Rules
Enforce strict unidirectional communication patterns:
- External users connect only to frontend
- Frontend communicates only with middleware
- Middleware communicates with backend when needed
- No direct frontend-to-backend communication allowed

#### DMZ Configuration
Frontend layer should include two DMZ segments:
- DMZ Inbound: Services accessible from internet, protected by WAF
- DMZ Outbound: Services with external network access but no inbound internet access

#### Firewall Policy Requirements
- Define explicit allow rules rather than broad network access
- Prohibit cross-system communication between different information systems at same layer
- Prevent middleware from accessing foreign backend systems directly
- Document all allowed network flows in security policy

### Interservice Communication Security

#### Between Different Applications
- Frontend and middleware segments of different systems cannot communicate directly
- Middleware cannot access backend segments of other services
- Each application should use dedicated network segments when possible

#### Load Balancer Approach
For organizations with fewer networks hosting multiple applications:
- Deploy load balancers within each network segment
- Open only one port to each network (to the load balancer)
- Perform traffic routing based on application layer parameters
- Note: This approach moves access control to OSI Layer 7 rather than network layer

### Network Security Policy Documentation

Organizations must maintain written policies describing:
- Firewall rules and network access permissions
- Visual diagrams showing allowed communication flows
- Specific provisions for different use cases

Policy should be accessible to:
- Network administrators
- Security representatives  
- IT auditors
- System architects and developers
- IT administrators

#### CI/CD Network Permissions
Define specific network access rules for software development systems, including:
- Source code repository access
- Build system connectivity
- Deployment pipeline network requirements

#### Secure Logging Architecture
Implement tamper-resistant logging:
- Copy logs to separate servers using syslog protocol
- Syslog allows only adding new events, preventing log modification
- Separate log storage from application systems
- Include both security events and attack indicators

#### Monitoring System Access
Define network policies for IT monitoring systems:
- Specify which segments monitoring tools can access
- Document data collection and alerting network flows
- Ensure monitoring doesn't create security bypass opportunities

### Implementation Best Practices

- Use visual network diagrams to communicate segmentation design
- Implement defense in depth with multiple firewall layers
- Regularly audit network access rules and segmentation effectiveness
- Test segmentation by attempting prohibited network connections
- Monitor network traffic for violations of segmentation policies
- Update segmentation rules as application architecture evolves

Network segmentation based on these principles, following the [comprehensive guidance](https://github.com/sergiomarotco/OWASP-Network-segmentation-cheat-sheet), provides foundational security that significantly reduces attack surface and limits potential breach impact.
