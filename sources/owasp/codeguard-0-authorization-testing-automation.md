Enforce Automated Authorization Testing Using a Formal Authorization Matrix

Automate authorization tests driven by a formal authorization matrix to detect regressions early and ensure reliable access control enforcement.

  1. **Define a formal authorization matrix file** (preferably XML or YAML) that lists:
    - All features/services/endpoints.
    - Logical roles and data filters if applicable.
    - Expected HTTP response codes for allowed and denied accesses.
    - Optional test payloads per service for richer testing.

  2. **Secure the authorization matrix**: Store matrix files encrypted at rest with appropriate access controls. Version control the matrix and restrict write access to authorized personnel only.

  3. **Automate integration tests** to:
    - Dynamically load and iterate over the matrix entries.
    - Generate role-based access tokens (e.g., JWT) matching each logical role.
    - Handle token lifecycle: refresh, expiration, and revocation scenarios.
    - Call each service endpoint as each role.
    - Validate actual HTTP response codes against expected allowed/denied codes from the matrix.
    - Report any discrepancies immediately, specifying involved role, service, and unexpected response.

  4. **Environment-specific configuration**: Support different authorization matrices and token configurations for development, testing, and production environments.

  5. **Secure the test environment**: Isolate test environments, use dedicated test accounts, and ensure test tokens cannot access production resources.

  6. Factorize test logic to centralize token creation, service calls, and response validation while isolating role-based POVs for clear error profiling.

  7. Maintain the authorization matrix as a living document alongside code; update it whenever authorization changes occur.

  8. Provide a readable, auditable view of the authorization matrix (HTML via XSLT or similar) accessible to developers and auditors for verification.
